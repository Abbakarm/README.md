# Abubakar's Data Science Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository! I am a **Statistics graduate** and a **3MTT Data Science Fellow** from Soba, Kaduna. I am building my technical skills to prepare for the 2026 Outreachy internship.

## 📊 My Current Focus
I am currently bridging the gap from theory to code. My daily learning includes:
- **SQL:** Mastering data queries and database management.
- **Python:** Learning Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis.
- **Git/GitHub:** Documenting my progress and collaborating with the global tech community.

## 🛠 Projects I'm Building
- [Digital Divide Analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/digital-divide) - A study on internet penetration in rural vs. urban Nigeria.
- [3MTT Weekly Tasks](https://github.com/yourusername/3mtt-tasks) - My coursework and assignments from the 3MTT program.

## 🌲 My Goal
My mission is to use data to solve infrastructure challenges in Northern Nigeria. I believe that **geography should not be a barrier to innovation.**
