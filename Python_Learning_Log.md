# My Python Learning Log 📖

## Date: Feb 18, 2026
Today I learned about the `def` keyword. 

### Key Takeaways:
- `def` is used to **define** a function (a recipe).
- Indentation is critical! It tells Python which lines belong to the function.
- I practiced writing a `calculate_fertilizer_cost` function on paper.

### My First Code Snippet:
```python
def greet_fellow(name):
    print("Hello " Abubakar Musa ", welcome to 3MTT!")
